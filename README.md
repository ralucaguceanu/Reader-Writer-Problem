# Reader Writer Problem

I implemented three different solutions for the Reader-Writer problem using parallel programming, leveraging a custom-built thread pool. 

The goal was to ensure data consistency while handling concurrent read and write operations efficiently. Each solution explores different synchronization strategies: one prioritizing reads and two prioritizing writes using distinct approaches.

The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring correctness and performance. The project demonstrates key concepts in parallel programming, thread management, and synchronization mechanisms.
